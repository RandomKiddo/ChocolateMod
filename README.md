### RandomKiddo

<sub>Lead Developer, Original Mod Creator, Texture Designer</sub>

I am a Physics major at the Ohio State University. Regardless, I love programming, and have worked on a plethora of personal projects. 
However, I wanted to work on something bigger, so I rounded up some of the most talented people I know (below), and merged my programming skills with Minecraft!
On this project, I mainly do development work, but I do know how to texture as well. Outside of this, I'm an avid gamer, tennis player, musician, and language learner!

### pranavmoola

<sub>Developer</sub>

My name is Pranav Moola and I am a freshman majoring in electrical engineering at Ohio State University. I enjoy playing tennis, hanging out with friends/family, and biking nature trails. I joined the Chocolate Mod to learn fabric modding and to explore a new area of programming. I also joined it because chocolate ice cream is superior to vanilla.
